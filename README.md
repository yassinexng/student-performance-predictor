# Student GPA Prediction: Linear Regression from Scratch

## Project Overview

This repository contains my first machine learning project - a complete implementation of linear regression to predict student GPAs. I've built all core components (prediction, cost function, gradient descent) using fundamental Python libraries to deeply understand how machine learning works under the hood.

### Key Features:
- **Custom implementation** of linear regression algorithms
- **Complete workflow** from data cleaning to model evaluation
- **Visual analysis** of student performance factors
- **Ready-to-run** with all files included

## What's Included
```
student-performance-predictor/
├── student_gpa_prediction.ipynb  # Main analysis notebook
├── Student_performance_data.csv  # Dataset (included in repo)
└── README.md                     # This documentation
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yassinexng/student-performance-predictor.git
cd student-performance-predictor
```

### 2. Install required packages
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### 3. Run the Jupyter notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook student_gpa_prediction.ipynb
```

## Implementation Details

### Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and custom algorithm implementation
- **Pandas**: For data loading and manipulation
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizations and analysis
- **scikit-learn**: For data standardization (StandardScaler)

### Dataset
The included `Student_performance_data.csv` contains:
- Study time (weekly hours)
- Absence records
- Parent education levels
- Extracurricular participation
- GPA values (target variable)

## About This Project

As my first machine learning implementation, this project represents an important step in my data science journey. I've focused on:
- Clear, documented code
- Thorough explanations of the math behind the algorithms
- Practical data preprocessing techniques
- Visual interpretation of results

I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement - please feel free to open an issue or reach out directly.
