# Predicting Student GPA: A Custom Linear Regression Approach

This project details the development of a **custom linear regression model** designed to predict student Grade Point Average (GPA). By systematically implementing the entire machine learningâ€”from initial data preprocessing and custom model training to comprehensive evaluationâ€”this work offers a transparent understanding of the foundational mathematics and mechanics underlying linear regression and gradient descent.

## âœ¨ Project Overview

* **End-to-End Implementation:** Executed a complete machine learning workflow, encompassing exploratory data analysis through to final model validation.
* **Custom Model Development:** Constructed the prediction function, cost calculation, and gradient descent algorithm using NumPy, prioritizing clarity over high-level library abstractions.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Applied essential techniques, including missing value handling, feature selection, and standardization, to ensure robust model performance.
* **Visual Insights:** Utilized Matplotlib for data distribution analysis, learning progression tracking, and feature importance assessment.
* **Foundational Learning:** This marks my first comprehensive machine learning project, solidifying practical understanding of core data science principles.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

This analysis utilizes the **[Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/students-performance-dataset)** from Kaggle.

**Important Note for Setup:** To run this project successfully, you must **download the `Student_performance_data .csv` file** from the provided Kaggle link. This file should then be placed into a **`data` subfolder** located within the root directory of this repository. The project's code is configured to load the dataset from this specific relative path (`data/Student_performance_data .csv`). It can also be found on this repository.

## What was used t ocreate this project:

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
 **Its main libraries used:** 
      * **NumPy:** Essential for numerical operations, array manipulation and custom model implementation.
      * **Pandas:** Employed for data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
      * **Matplotlib:** Utilized for creating informative visualizations.
      * **Scikit-learn (StandardScaler):** Used specifically for robust feature scaling.

##  How to Run This Project

To set up and explore this project locally, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yassinexng/student-performance-predictor.git](https://github.com/yassinexng/student-performance-predictor.git)
    cd student-performance-predictor
    ```
2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install "numpy<2" pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
    *(Note: "numpy<2" is specified to ensure compatibility with other libraries compiled against NumPy 1.x.)*
4.  **Place the Dataset:**
    * Download `Student_performance_data .csv` from the [Kaggle dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/students-performance-dataset).
    * Create a folder named `data` in the root of this repository.
    * Place the downloaded `.csv` file into the `data` folder.
    * Ensure your directory structure matches:
        ```
        student-performance-predictor/
        â”œâ”€â”€ student_gpa_prediction.ipynb
        â””â”€â”€ data/
            â””â”€â”€ Student_performance_data .csv
        ```
5.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    * From your terminal within the project's root directory (and with the virtual environment activated), execute: `jupyter notebook`
    * This will open Jupyter in your web browser. You can then navigate to and open `student_gpa_prediction.ipynb` to execute the analysis cells.

##  Feedback Welcome:
As my initial end-to-end machine learning project, I am committed to continuous learning and improvement. Any constructive feedback regarding the methodology, code, or presentation of this work would be highly valuable and genuinely appreciated. Please feel free to open an issue or connect directly.
